# CMPM 120 Group project / Project Archive

### TODO / Tasks:

# [Project Archive] The team has submitted a self-contained archive of their design and deployment work (e.g. a repository on GitHub). This archive contains some documentation (e.g. a README.md file) that is immediately visible even to non-technical audiences.
* This is the README that contains documentation of our project accomplishments
# [Main Game] https://markviews.github.io/CMPM120/
# [Prototypes]: 
1. https://github.com/markviews/CMPM120/tree/main/Core%20Gameplay%20Prototype
2. https://github.com/markviews/CMPM120/tree/main/Scene%20Flow%20Prototype
3. https://github.com/markviews/CMPM120/tree/main/Cinematics%20Prototype
# [Theme]: 
The main character of the game is sent to a different timeline and has to find a way to get back to their own timeline, this is by a means of a portal which is near but they will have to get through challenging tasks to reach it.
# [Selectable requirements]:
* # Data-Driven Experience Progression: 
* * Our game loads information from JSON that contains level data (current level, level background, music, number of decorations, number of monsters, whether to spawn a boss or not, and door entered). We also have another Json file which contains the exact placement of tiles and their exact location on the map. 
* * These two such files are: tile_properties.json levelData.json
* # Advanced Visual Assets:
* * We included video assets titled:
1. Dashing.mp4
2. KillEnemies.mp4
* * We also created intriqute tween animations using sprites with code.
* # Inventory System: (Approved by Adam Smith)
* * The Inventory system implements "Concurrent scenes (multiple scenes are running at the same time)". This chosen requirement was approved by Adam, Evidence: https://discord.com/channels/1092546117784318062/1094670434483568762/1116470118520729680
